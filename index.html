        <ul>
            <li>Large pot with a tight-fitting lid</li>
            <li>Wooden spoon</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Tomato Stew Base:</strong> Blend 10 large fresh tomatoes, 4 red bell peppers, 2 scotch bonnet peppers, and 1 onion until smooth. Boil the mixture in a pot over medium heat for 20-30 minutes until it thickens and reduces. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Wash the Rice:</strong> Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the Base:</strong> Heat 1 cup of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add sliced onions and sauté until translucent (about 5 minutes). Stir in 4 tablespoons of tomato paste and fry for 3-5 minutes until it darkens slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Tomato Stew:</strong> Pour in the prepared tomato stew base and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.</li>
            <li><strong>Season the Base:</strong> Add curry powder, thyme, seasoning cubes, white pepper, and bay leaves. Stir well and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Stock:</strong> Pour in 2 liters of chicken or beef stock. Taste and adjust with salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong> Add the washed rice to the pot, stirring to ensure it’s fully coated with the stew. Reduce heat to low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and cook for 30-40 minutes. Check occasionally, adding a little water (1/4 cup at a time) if needed to prevent burning.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Vegetables and Protein:</strong> When the rice is almost done (about 80% cooked), stir in the mixed vegetables and cooked protein (if using). Cover and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed the flavors.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Doneness:</strong> The rice should be soft but not mushy, with a vibrant red color. Remove bay leaves and fluff with a fork.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve hot with sides like fried plantain, coleslaw, or grilled chicken.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Authentic Party Jollof</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use parboiled rice for the best texture, as it holds up well during cooking.</li>
            <li>For a smoky flavor, let the rice slightly burn at the bottom (optional, but traditional for party jollof).</li>
            <li>Adjust scotch bonnet peppers to control spiciness.</li>
            <li>Prepare the tomato stew base in advance to save time.</li>
        </ul>
